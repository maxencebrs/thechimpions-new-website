## How It Works
When you delegate your SOL to The Chimpions validator, you’re directly helping secure the network while supporting a values-driven DAO.

You can either:
- Stake directly to our validator via wallet
- Or swap to the LST token **ChimpSol**

## Why Stake with Chimpions?
- Among the best APYs on Solana
- Access to the Treehouse sub-community
- Eligible for exclusive airdrops & editions
- Revenue helps fund DAO initiatives

## Solana DeFi Integration
ChimpSol is being integrated into the broader Solana DeFi ecosystem:
- **Loopscale integration is live** with a 4x multiplier
- More integrations to come

## How to Delegate
### Option 1: Stake directly in your wallet
Open Phantom, Backpack, Solflare, etc.
Go to: Stake → Validators
Search: Chimpions or paste validator address
Choose amount and confirm

### Option 2: Mint ChimpSol (Liquid Staking)
Use our built-in Jupiter Terminal widget to swap SOL → ChimpSol
ChimpSol is composable and grows your yield over time
