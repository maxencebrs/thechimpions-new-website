## What is ChimpSwap?
ChimpSwap is a mechanism to help holders find the Chimpion they most identify with — and enable large holders to earn passive income by listing Chimpions as swappable.

## How It Works
- Holders of multiple Chimpions can list some of their NFTs as "Swapable"
- Any holder can visit ChimpSwap and choose a swappable Chimpion
- A 1 SOL fee is charged for each swap
  - 75% goes to the original holder
  - 25% goes to the DAO treasury
